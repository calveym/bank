## Bank tech test
This is my response to the [following tech test.](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/individual_challenges/bank_tech_test.md)
I wrote my solution in javascript, and it runs locally in the browser.

###Architecture:
The solution is based around two main classes: BankAccount, which handles all aspects of dealing with the account, depositing withdrawing etc, and AccountStatement, which deals with recording bank history and formatting the history for pretty printing.
